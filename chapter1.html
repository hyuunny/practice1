    <h2>Photograph</h2>
    <p>A photograph (also known as a photo) is an image created<br>
      by light falling on a photosensitive surface,
      usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, <br>such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera,
       which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light<br> into a reproduction of what the human eye would see.<br>
       The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.
